It is possible to &quot;browse&quot; an LDAP directory hierarchically, starting with the
directory's &quot;Search Base&quot;.  Click the small triangle to the left of an entry to
expand it. This will display all of the entries one &quot;level&quot; down. Click the
small triangle again to collapse the list. Selecting an entry will display its attributes
and values in the text field below the list. LDapper only fetches an entry's details from
the server when you select it.  Unlike a search window, you cannot copy/paste, drag and
drop, export, or &quot;mailto:&quot; selected entries.
</p>		
<p>
Browsing appends each command's output to the Command Output text rather than
replacing it. As with Search windows, you can export the Details and Command Output
text.
</p>
<p>
If you find yourself using LDapper to browse more often than search, you can
use Preferences to switch the default document type to browse. Normally,
LDapper uses Cmd-N to create a new search window and Shift-Cmd-N to create a
new browse window. Switching the default document to browse swaps these. The
default document type is also the type of window that is created when LDapper
is first launched or when you switch to LDapper by clicking its icon in the
dock (if there are no other documents open).

You can modify several options to use when browsing. Many of these are the same
as those for searching, and like setting Search options, to set these options just
for the current Browse window, select &quot;Browse Options&quot; from the LDAP
menu. To set the options as defaults for all Browse windows, modify them in
&quot;Preferences&quot;.
</p>
<ul class="indent">
<li><i>Fetch attributes</i> - which attributes should be fetched from the server?
The choices are All, Operational, All + Operational.
</li>
<li><i>Time limit</i> - wait at most this long for a search to complete. Set this to 0 to
wait forever. The default is 60 seconds.
</li>
<li><i>Connect timeout</i> - wait at most this long for the initial network connection
to the LDAP server to complete. This is a separate timeout value than &quot;Time
limit&quot; above. Note that if you have specified Request/Require StartTLS, this
option may not be used so if LDapper is unable to connect, you will probably end up
waiting until the connection is timed out by the operating system, usually 75
seconds. I don't know if this is by design or a bug in ldapsearch.
</li>
<li><i>Decode Base64</i> - should values that include Base64 encoded data, e.g., photos
or text data with special characters, be decoded when adding to the Address List?
Note that even if this is enabled, the Base64 encoded value will still appear in
the Command Output text because it is meant to display the ldapsearch output verbatim.
</li>
<li><i>Discard output</i> - should output from the ldapsearch command be discarded
instead of added to the Command Output text?
</li>
<li><i>Debug level</i> - enables and specifies the debug level for the ldapsearch command.
Note that the extra info returned by ldapsearch may make it impossible for LDapper to
parse the results correctly. You can see the debug/trace results in the &quot;Command
Output&quot; text.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that the &quot;Max # Hits&quot;, &quot;Discard responses without email&quot;, &quot;Search
for people only&quot;, and &quot;Show friendly attributes&quot; options are disabled or
ignored for Browse windows.
