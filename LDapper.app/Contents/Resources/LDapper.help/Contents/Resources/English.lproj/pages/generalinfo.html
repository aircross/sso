<p>
LDapper is an LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) client for finding email addresses. You can look
up people by name, department, or some other arbitrary attribute. Once you have a list of people, you can
copy/paste or drag addresses into a new email message. You can probably automagically add them to a new email 
message by choosing the &quot;Mail To&quot; menu. You can export addresses directly into your Mac's Contacts
(aka Address Book) or files that can be imported into other applications. With LDapper, you can also browse
an LDAP server in a hierarchical fashion.
</p>
<p>
Unlike older versions of LDapper which used the LDAP framework (or OpenLDAP libraries) directly, this
version is really a &quot;wrapper&quot; around the built-in LDAP utility ldapsearch that is included by default
with Mac OS X. You can think of LDapper as a GUI &quot;front-end&quot; to ldapsearch. Many of the options and
preferences you specify simply modify the command line arguments to the ldapsearch command. This version of
LDapper uses separate preferences than previous versions so you can continue to use an older version if you
wish. The first time you run this version, LDapper will import any directories from the old version. Any
subsequent changes to those directories will only affect the new version. LDapper now requires Mac OS X 10.7
(Lion) or later.
