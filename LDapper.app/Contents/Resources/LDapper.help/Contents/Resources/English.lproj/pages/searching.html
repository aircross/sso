You can change several of the settings, e.g., the directory and search criteria,
before doing a search. You can have up to 4 criteria for searching. Click the (+)
and (-) buttons to add and remove criteria. When searching, LDapper will find
entries that match ALL criteria, i.e., AND not OR. Use the popup menu(s) to choose
which attribute(s) you want to search for, the search type (is, is similarto, contains,
starts with, ends with, is anything, is missing), enter some text in the search field(s),
and then click the Search button or select the Search command in the LDAP menu.
</p>
<p>
If required, you will be prompted for a password. If your password is stored
in your keychain but you don't want to use it for some reason, or if you need to
specify/change your identification, press the Option key while starting a search
and you will always be prompted.
</p>
<p>
LDapper will build the ldapsearch command using the options you specify and then
run ldapsearch. It will parse any output from the ldapsearch command and add the
entries returned to the &quot;Address List&quot;. If you just want to see the
ldapsearch command and not actually run it, hold down the Control key when
starting a search.
</p>
<p>
If you select a person in the Address List, their info will appear in the
&quot;Details&quot; text at the bottom of the window. LDapper can save the actual
output from the ldapsearch command. You can switch between the Details and the
Command Output text by clicking on the Details/Output buttons. LDapper adds the
ldapsearch command and its arguments at the top of the Command Output text.
You <i>should</i> be able to copy the command and paste it in Terminal to run
the ldapsearch command directly. If you just want to get the command but not
actually perform a search, press the Shift key while starting a search. Also,
any error text, i.e., stderr, will appear below the output. You can export the
Details (or Command Output) text to a file.
</p>
<p>
You can export the Details for selected or all addresses to a file.  You can
save the text as plain text (.txt) or rich text format (.rtf) to get bold
attributes. If any of the details contains photos, you can save as rich text
format with attachments (.rtfd) to include the photos in the file. Note that
photos in the info are resized so that the maximum height or width is 256 pixels
so it may be smaller that the actual image in the directory. (You can also drag
images from the Info text and LDapper will create jpeg files.) Command Output text
is always exported as plain text.

<div class="section" id="section_2">
<p>
You can modify several options to use when performing a search. To set these options
just for the current Search window, select &quot;Search Options&quot; from the LDAP
menu. To set the options as defaults for all Search windows, modify them in
&quot;Preferences&quot;.
</p>
<ul class="indent">
<li><i>Fetch attributes</i> - which attributes should be fetched from the server?
The choices are Minimal, All, Operational, All + Operational, and None. The default
is to fetch All attributes. &quot;Minimal&quot; will fetch only the last name (sn),
full name (cn), department (ou), email (mail), and the &quot;other&quot; (if any)
attributes for the directory. &quot;Operational&quot; returns attributes used by
servers for administering the directory system itself. &quot;None&quot; will
return just the &quot;distinguished names&quot; (dn) of any matching entries.
</li>
<li><i>Max # hits</i> - the maximum number of responses you want to receive from the
LDAP server. Set this to 0 to indicate no limit. The default is 100. Note that
there may be a limit set by the server. One interesting thing related to this
value is that if your search uses too many resources on the server, e.g., searching
on a non-indexed attribute, LDapper may receive a &quot;max hits exceeded&quot;
error from the server even though there really weren't that many matches. This
probably won't happen on normal searches.
</li>
<li><i>Time limit</i> - wait at most this long for a search to complete. Set this to 0 to
wait forever. The default is 60 seconds.
</li>
<li><i>Connect timeout</i> - wait at most this long for the initial network connection
to the LDAP server to complete. This is a separate timeout value than &quot;Time
limit&quot; above. Note that if you have specified Request/Require StartTLS, this
option may not be used so if LDapper is unable to connect, you will probably end up
waiting until the connection is timed out by the operating system, usually 75
seconds. I don't know if this is by design or a bug in ldapsearch.
</li>
<li><i>Discard responses without email</i> - should responses that are missing email
addresses be ignored? If this is not enabled, entires in the list without email
addresses will show &quot;n/a&quot; instead. You will not be able to include any
of these (non-)addresses when preforming a &quot;mailto&quot; and they may be
skipped when exporting as well. This option is ignored if you are fetching
&quot;Operational&quot; or &quot;None&quot; attributes.
</li>			
<li><i>Search for people only</i> - should LDapper limit a search to only people, i.e.,
those entries with an objectclass value of &quot;person&quot;? (This value can be
modified when editing a directory.)
</li>
<li><i>Show friendly attributes</i> - specifies how attributes should be displayed in the
&quot;Info&quot; field. If enabled, a more descriptive attribute is uses, e.g.,
&quot;Last Name&quot; instead of &quot;sn&quot;. If disabled, the actual attribute
is displayed.
</li>
<li><i>Decode Base64</i> - should values that include Base64 encoded data, e.g., photos
or text data with special characters, be decoded when adding to the Address List?
Note that even if this is enabled, the Base64 encoded value will still appear in
the Command Output text because it is meant to display the ldapsearch output verbatim.
</li>
<li><i>Discard output</i> - should output from the ldapsearch command be discarded
instead of added to the Command Output text?
</li>
<li><i>Debug level</i> - enables and specifies the debug level for the ldapsearch command.
Note that the extra info returned by ldapsearch may make it impossible for LDapper to
parse the results correctly. You can see the debug/trace results in the &quot;Command
Output&quot; text.
</li>
</ul>

LDapper will remember the last search and use its criteria when you open a new search window.
</p>
<p>
LDapper also allows you to save searches, similar to a web browser's bookmarks. To view
them, select the &quot;Saved Searches&quot; window menu.  You can add, modify, and delete
searches from this window.  To add the criteria in an active Search window, select the
&quot;Save Current Search&quot; command in the LDAP&rarr;Saved Searches menu.  You can reorder
the saved searches dragging them.
<p>
Each saved search has a name which appears in the Saved Searches menu. Selecting one of those
menus will apply that search's criteria to the Search window. You can also drag a saved search
to a Search window to use it (or click the &quot;Use Selected Search&quot; button.)

<p>
After a successful search, matching entries should appear the the &quot;Address List&quot;
</p>
<p class="indent">
<strong>Copying/Dragging Addresses</strong>
</p>
<p class="indent">
Click one or more entries in the address list to select them. You can then
copy/paste or drag them to your email application or to a text clipping in the
Finder. Entries without email addresses will not be included. Different email
applications handle copying (and dragging) of addresses differently. You will
need to experiment with some settings to see what works best with your email
application. You can specify in Preferences which delimiter you want to use to
separate the entries. These include commas, new lines, tabs, semicolons, and
spaces. If you have an application that uses some other delimiter, please let
me know, and I'll add it to the list. If the &quot;Include personal names&quot;
preference is enabled, you'll get &quot;name &lt;email&gt;,name &lt;email&gt;&quot;.
If disabled, you'll get &quot;email,email&quot;. There is also a setting in
Preferences to change the format from &quot;name &lt;email&gt;&quot; to &quot;email
(name)&quot;.
</p>
<p class="indent">
<strong>&quot;Mail To:&quot;</strong>
</p>
<p class="indent">
LDapper can automagically create a new email message pre-addressed with selected
addresses if your email application supports this. (Most email apps do.) This works
the same way as if you had clicked on a &quot;mailto:&quot; URL in a web page so
any program that can be set up as a mailto URL helper should work. LDapper will
use your default email application. Select one or more entries in the address
list, then select the &quot;Mail To:&quot; menu to send the address(es) to your
email application. Double-clicking an address will do the same thing.
</p>
<p class="indent">
Note that sending addresses to your email application in this manner will not
include personal names. If you want personal names, you must use copy/paste or
drag and drop instead.
</p>
<p class="indent">
<strong>Exporting Addresses</strong>
</p>
<p class="indent">
You can export selected addresses by choosing an item in the &quot;Export Addresses&quot;
menu. If no addresses are selected, you will export all addresses. The current export formats are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Address Book</i><br>
<br>
This does not actually save to a file, but instead adds the addresses to the
OS X Contacts (Address Book). A group named &quot;From LDapper&quot; will be created and
the addresses will be added to that group.
<li><i>Address (Name)</i><br>
<br>
address (name)<br>
address (name)<br>
address<br>
address (name)<br>
etc.</br>
</li>
<li><i>Name &lt;Address></i><br>
<br>
name &lt;address><br>
address<br>
name &lt;address><br>
name &lt;address><br>
etc.<br>
</li>
<li><i>Pseudo LDIF</i><br>
<br>
dn: the dn<br>
attr: value<br>
attr: value<br>
attr: value<br>
attr: value<br>
<br>
dn: the dn<br>
attr: value<br>
attr: value<br>
attr: value<br>
attr: value<br>
<br>
etc.<br>
<br>
This is not a true LDIF file. Long lines are not folded, and images and binary
values are replaced with the strings &quot;&lt;image data&gt;&quot; and
&quot;&lt;binary data&gt;&quot;. If you really need the original LDIF data,
you can get it from the Command Output text or just run the ldapsearch command
in Terminal.
</li>
</ul>
